Global Sensitivity Analysis
===========================
Global Sensitivity Analysis can be performed when a user is interested in parameter distribution rather than single point values, and how sensitive a specific output is towards perturbations in different parameters. Instructions on what settings are required to be specified can be found in the :ref:`Global Sensitivity Analysis section of the settings file<stg.gsa>`.
