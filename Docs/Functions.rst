Functions
=========

The MATLAB&trade; functions used in this workflow are divided acording to their role, we have:

  - :ref:`Functions to import the model to MATLAB&trade; and generate model specific files and functions<functions_import>`
  - :ref:`Functions relating to the simulation of the model,<functions_simulation>`  
  - :ref:`Functions for analysis that we can perform on the model,<functions_analysis>`  
  - :ref:`Functions to plot the result of the different analyses,<functions_plots>`  
  - :ref:`General purpose functions.<functions_general>`
