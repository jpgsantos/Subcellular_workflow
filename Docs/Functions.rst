Functions
=========

The MATLAB\ |Reg| functions used in this workflow are divided acording to their role, we have:

  
  - :ref:`Setup and Import functions<functions_import>`
  
      Functions to import the model to MATLAB\ |Reg|\  and generate model specific files and functions.

  - :ref:`Simulation and scoring functions<functions_simulation>`
  
      Functions relating to the simulation and scoring of the model.
  
  - :ref:`Analysis functions<functions_analysis>`
  
      Functions for the analysis that we can perform on the model.

  - :ref:`Ploting unctions<functions_plots>`
  
      Functions to plot the result of the different analyses.

  - :ref:`General purpose functions<functions_general>`
  
      General purpose functions that are usually used by other functions.
