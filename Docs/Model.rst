Models
======

We have used multiple models to validate our software tools.
Each model has its own repository. 
In these repositories you can find;

 - The model in different formats relevant for the various tools that we provide
 - "Matlab" folder with:
 
   - Settings file relevant to use the model with our MATLAB\ |Reg| tools
   - Some examples of the output provided by our MATLAB\ |Reg| tools after running an Analysis
   This is also the folder were all the run time ouptuts of the matlab analysis are stored.
   
 - "Bionetgen and Steps" folder with relevant files for running the model in the subcellular aplication 
 - "Neuron" folder  with relevant files for running the model in NEURON.

Note: Model_Fujita_2010 does not contain "Bionetgen and Steps" and "Neuron" folders as this model was not implemented in these softwares.
