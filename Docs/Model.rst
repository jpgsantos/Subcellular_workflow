Implemented models
==================

We have used multiple models to validate our software tools.
Each model has its own repository. 
In these repositories you can find;

 - The model in different formats relevant for the various tools that we provide
 - A settings file relevant to use the model with our MATLAB\ |Reg| tools
 - Some examples of the output provided by our MATLAB\ |Reg| tools after running an Analysis
