Subcellular application (https://subcellular.humanbrainproject.eu/model/meta) provides a web interface for simulation of biomolecular networks expressed on bionetgen language () using network free solver NFsim and reaction-diffusion stochastic systems solver STEPS ()

Models can be imported from an sbml file. This repository represent the use case model example, transformed to bngl format for simulation with STEPS TetOpSplit solver.
