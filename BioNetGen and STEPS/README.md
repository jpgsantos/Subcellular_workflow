Subcellular application (https://subcellular.humanbrainproject.eu/model/meta) provides a web interface for simulation of biomolecular networks expressed on bionetgen language (https://www.csb.pitt.edu/Faculty/Faeder/?page_id=409) using network free solver NFsim and reaction-diffusion stochastic systems solver STEPS (http://steps.sourceforge.net/STEPS/documentation.php)

Models can be imported from an sbml file. This repository represent the use case model example, transformed to bngl format for simulation with STEPS TetOpSplit solver.
