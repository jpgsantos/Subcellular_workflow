COMMENT
Presynaptic spike generator
---------------------------

This mechanism has been written to be able to use synapses in a single
neuron receiving various types of presynaptic trains.  This is a "fake"
presynaptic compartment containing a fast spike generator.  The trains
of spikes can be either periodic or noisy (Poisson-distributed), and 
either tonic or bursting.

Parameters;
   noise: 	between 0 (no noise-periodic) and 1 (fully noisy)
   fast_invl: 	fast interval, mean time between spikes (ms)
   slow_invl:	slow interval, mean burst silent period (ms), 0=tonic train
   burst_len: 	mean burst length (nb. spikes)
